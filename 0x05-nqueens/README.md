# 0x05. N Queens
The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.
# Concepts Needed:
- Backtracking Algorithms:
-- Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.

- Recursion:
-- Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.

- List Manipulations in Python:
-- Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.

- Usage: nqueens N
-- If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
- where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
-- If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
-- If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
- The program should print every possible solution to the problem
-- One solution per line
	+ Format: see example
-- You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
- You are only allowed to import the sys module
